- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with proper HTTP status codes

### Phase 2: Mobile App Model Updates  
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### Updated Eight Learning Models:
```dart
✅ CourseModel.dart: test/courses → learning/my-subscriptions
✅ CourseCategoryModel.dart: test/course-categories → learning/dashboard  
✅ CourseUnitModel.dart: test/course-units → learning/course-units
✅ CourseMaterialModel.dart: test/course-materials → learning/course-materials
✅ CourseQuizModel.dart: test/course-quizzes → learning/course-quizzes
✅ CourseProgressModel.dart: test/course-progress → learning/my-progress
✅ CourseSubscriptionModel.dart: test/course-subscriptions → learning/my-subscriptions
✅ CourseReviewModel.dart: test/course-reviews → learning/reviews
✅ CourseQuizAnswerModel.dart: test/course-quiz-answers → learning/quiz-answers
```

### Phase 3: Enhanced Controller Functionality
**Status: COMPLETED**

#### New LearningController Methods:
- ✅ `getMySubscriptions()` - Get user's active course subscriptions
- ✅ `getMyProgress()` - Get user's learning progress across all courses
- ✅ `submitQuizAnswer()` - Submit quiz completion with scoring
- ✅ `getQuizAnswers()` - Get user's quiz submission history

#### Enhanced Features:
- ✅ Comprehensive learning dashboard with statistics
- ✅ Material progress tracking with 5-minute minimum view time
- ✅ Quiz scoring system with pass/fail logic (70% threshold)  
- ✅ Certificate generation tracking
- ✅ Learning notification system
- ✅ Course review and rating system

## 🔧 TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### Database Models:
```
✅ Course (with category relationship)
✅ CourseUnit (belongs to course)
✅ CourseMaterial (belongs to unit)  
✅ CourseQuiz (belongs to unit)
✅ CourseQuizAnswer (user quiz submissions)
✅ CourseSubscription (user course access)
✅ CourseProgress (detailed progress tracking)
✅ CourseCertificate (completion certificates)
✅ CourseReview (user ratings & reviews)
✅ CourseNotification (learning notifications)
```

### API Response Format:
```json
{
  "code": 1,
  "message": "Success message",  
  "data": {
    // Response data
  }
}
```

### Error Handling:
- ✅ Proper HTTP status codes (200, 401, 403, 404, 422, 500)
- ✅ Detailed error messages for debugging
- ✅ Input validation with Laravel Validator
- ✅ Database transaction rollbacks on failures

## 🎯 CORPORATE READINESS FEATURES

## 📱 MOBILE APP INTEGRATION

### Updated API Calls:
All Flutter models now use professional endpoints with proper authentication headers. The mobile app will need to:

1. ✅ **Authentication**: Ensure all API calls include Bearer token
2. ✅ **Endpoint Updates**: All models updated to use professional endpoints  
3. ⚠️  **Response Handling**: May need updates for new response structures
4. ⚠️  **Error Handling**: Update error handling for new HTTP status codes

### Recommended Mobile App Updates:
```dart
// Example authentication header
headers: {
  'Authorization': 'Bearer $userToken',
  'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  'Accept': 'application/json'
}
```
